# About the Community
## Purpose
LondonTechJP is a networking group for Japanese engineers living in the UK.  
Our mission is to provide a place where Japanese engineers can connect, exchange knowledge, and learn from each other.  
We regularly organize study sessions and social gatherings to promote technical growth, facilitate information sharing, and strengthen ties within the community.

## Call for Sponsors
LondonTechJP is currently seeking sponsor companies to support our community activities.

As a volunteer-driven, non-profit networking community, we aim to foster knowledge sharing and professional connections among Japanese engineers based in the UK.  
Through our study sessions and networking events, we strive to contribute to the growth of participants and the wider community.

### Ways You Can Support
- **Venue Provision**: Offering your company’s office meeting room, or sponsoring a rental venue  
- **Networking Reception Support (optional)**: Providing a venue, light meals, or drinks for the reception, which greatly helps to promote interaction among participants  

Our activities are run entirely on a volunteer basis and for non-profit purposes.  
All contributions are used exclusively to operate and maintain study sessions and networking events.

We welcome both ongoing sponsorships as well as one-time sponsorships aimed at recruitment or promotional purposes.  

### Sponsorship Benefits
Sponsors will receive the following benefits:

- **Product / Company Introduction Time**  
  For venue sponsors, we will provide up to 5 minutes during the event for product introduction, company overview, or recruitment PR.

- **Event Promotion Page Listing**  
  Your company will be acknowledged as a sponsor on the event announcement page, with up to 500 words available for product introduction or recruitment advertisement.

- **On-site Distribution of Goods**  
  Sponsors may freely distribute promotional items, novelties, or informational materials at the event.

- **Reserved Participant Slots**  
  While study sessions are planned for around 20–30 participants, sponsors will receive priority slots for up to 5 people (1 presenter for PR plus up to 4 additional participants), separate from speaker slots.
